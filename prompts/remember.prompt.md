Review this conversation and store key decisions, learnings, and context in memory for future reference.

Identify and record:
- **Decisions Made**: What was decided and why
- **Learnings**: New insights, patterns, or knowledge discovered
- **Context**: Important background information about the project or task
- **Next Steps**: What should happen next or what remains incomplete
- **Pitfalls Avoided**: Failed approaches or gotchas to remember

Use the memory tool to:
1. View existing memory to avoid duplication
2. Update relevant existing entries or create new ones as appropriate
3. Keep entries organized and clearly named
4. Include timestamps for time-sensitive information

Focus on information that will be valuable across conversations, not temporary details.
